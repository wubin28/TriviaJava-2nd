Steps of taming the bad code
  * Run the client GameRunner to see the output.
  * Check the public interface (i.e. all the public methods) of the server side classes to see how they are used by clients.
  * If a public method of a server side class is not used by a client, change it from public to private.
  * Read the code of the client GameRunner and pay attention how the public interface of the server side is used by the client.
  * Read the code of the class Game and pay attention to the public methods.

  * List all the behaviors of the public interface of server side called by clients.
  * List all major behaviours of the code to be tamed which are not going to be changed in the near future.
  * Write characterization tests for all the public interface of the server side.
  * Write characterization tests for all the major behaviours except for those included in the public interface.

  * Do not touch client side code in refactoring.
  * Eliminate all duplicated code.
  * Break responsibilities of big classes into new classes. Find all the nouns from the descriptions of all the major behaviours and use them to be the candidates of new classes.
  * Use Sonar to fix all Major and more severe issues.


To Do
=====
  * Make method Game.createRockQuestion() private since it's not used by any clients.

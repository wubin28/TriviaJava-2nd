Steps of taming the bad code
  * Run the client GameRunner to see the output.
  * Check the public interface (i.e. all the public methods) of the server side classes to see if they are used by clients.

  * Do not touch client side code in refactoring.
  * If a public method of a server side class is not used by any client, change it from public to private.
  * Remove all public methods which are not used anywhere in the code base.

  * Read the code of the server side and pay attention to the implementation of the  public methods at first.
  * Eliminate all duplicated code.

  * List all the behaviors of the public interface of server side called by clients.
  * List all major behaviours of the code to be tamed which are not going to be changed in the near future.
  * Write characterization tests for all the public interface of the server side.
  * Write characterization tests for all the major behaviours except for those included in the public interface.

  * Break responsibilities of big classes into new classes. Find all the nouns from the descriptions of all the major behaviours and use them to be the candidates of new classes.
  * Use Sonar to fix all Major and more severe issues.


To Do
=====
  * Make method Game.createRockQuestion() private since it's not used by any clients.
